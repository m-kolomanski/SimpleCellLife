Simple cell life simulation. This time Imma do it for real.

<h2>22-04-19</h2>
Reworked cell splitting to be based around the tile owner, representing each "player" getting a "turn". Added simple stats to be printed out.
<h2>22-04-16</h2>
Implemented very simple owner and tile classes.
<h2>22-04-06:</h2>
Very basic simple script. Generates a matrix with 0's representing empty spaces and a single 1, representing a cell. The cell can then split and occupy neighbouring places. The cell also has a chance to mutate, represented by adding +1 to cell value.
